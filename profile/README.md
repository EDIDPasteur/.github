# Evolutionary Biology of Infectious Diseases (EDID) Lab 🦠🧬

Welcome to the Evolutionary Biology of Infectious Diseases (EDID) Lab! 🌟 Our lab is dedicated to understanding the intricate dynamics of infectious diseases through the lens of evolutionary biology. By integrating multidisciplinary approaches, we aim to shed light on the mechanisms that drive the evolution and spread of pathogens, and to develop innovative strategies for disease control and prevention.

## Research Focus

Our research spans a wide range of topics within the field of evolutionary biology and infectious diseases, including:

- **Pathogen Evolution**: Studying the genetic and phenotypic changes that occur in pathogens over time, and how these changes influence their ability to infect hosts and evade immune responses. 🧬
- **Host-Pathogen Interactions**: Exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern the interactions between pathogens and their hosts, with a focus on co-evolutionary dynamics. 🔬
- **Epidemiology and Disease Dynamics**: Investigating the patterns and drivers of disease outbreaks, and developing predictive models to inform public health strategies. 🌍
- **Genomic Surveillance**: Utilizing genomic sequencing technologies to monitor the spread and evolution of infectious diseases in real-time, enabling rapid response to emerging threats. 🧫
- **Drug Resistance and Vaccine Efficacy**: Examining the evolutionary pressures that lead to drug resistance and vaccine escape, and developing strategies to overcome these challenges. 💉
