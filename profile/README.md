# Evolutionary Biology of Infectious Diseases (EDID) Lab 🦠🧬

Welcome to the Evolutionary Biology of Infectious Diseases (EDID) Lab! 🌟 We are part of the the Computational Biology Departmen at the tInstitut Pasteur in Paris, France.

## Research Focus

Our research spans a wide range of topics within the field of evolutionary biology and infectious diseases, including:

- **Pathogen Evolution**: Studying the genetic and phenotypic changes that occur in pathogens over time, and how these changes influence their ability to infect hosts and evade immune responses. 🧬
- **Host-Pathogen Interactions**: Exploring the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern the interactions between pathogens and their hosts, with a focus on co-evolutionary dynamics. 🔬
- **Epidemiology and Disease Dynamics**: Investigating the patterns and drivers of disease outbreaks, and developing predictive models to inform public health strategies. 🌍
- **Genomic Surveillance**: Utilizing genomic sequencing technologies to monitor the spread and evolution of infectious diseases in real-time, enabling rapid response to emerging threats. 🧫
- **Drug Resistance and Vaccine Efficacy**: Examining the evolutionary pressures that lead to drug resistance and vaccine escape, and developing strategies to overcome these challenges. 💉
